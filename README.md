# Chat Components

This repository is work-in-progress and will contain reusable components Cognigy uses in various of their products in order to render chat-messages such as:
- text messages
- galleries
- quick replies
- buttons
- images

and much more. We aim to use these components in various products such as:
- Cognigy.AI - as part of our Interaction Panel
- Cognigy Insights - as part of the Transcript Explorer
- Cognigy Live Agent - in order to render the Chat history
- Webchat v3 - our new Webchat Widget

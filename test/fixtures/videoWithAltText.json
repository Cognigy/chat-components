							"altText": "[00:00]\nAmbient sounds of the launch pad: distant rumbling, hissing of gases, occasional mechanical clicks.\n\n[00:10]\nThe rumbling intensifies as the engines begin to ignite, building in volume.\n\n[00:15]\nThe roar of the engines becomes deafening as the rocket prepares for liftoff. The ground starts to vibrate.\n\n[00:18]\nSudden, loud explosion of sound as the engines reach full throttle, followed by a sharp crackling noise as the rocket leaves the launch pad.\n\n[00:20]\nThe sound of the rocket ascending, with a powerful, continuous roar, accompanied by a whooshing noise as it pierces through the atmosphere.\n\n[00:30]\nThe roar gradually decreases as the rocket climbs higher, mixing with the sound of wind rushing past.\n\n[00:45]\nSudden, muffled thump as the rocket passes through maximum aerodynamic pressure (Max Q). The sound briefly dips in intensity.\n\n[01:00]\nDistinct, sharp bursts as the solid rocket boosters separate and fall away, followed by a slight pause before the core stage continues its burn.\n\n[01:20]\nThe continuous rumble of the main engines, now steadier, as the rocket enters the upper atmosphere.\n\n[01:40]\nAnother set of clicks and metallic clangs as the core stage shuts down and separates.\n\n[02:00]\nA softer, sustained rumble as the upper stage engine ignites, pushing the spacecraft further into orbit.\n\n[02:20]\nThe sound begins to fade as the rocket reaches the edge of space, leaving behind a faint, distant hum.\n\n[02:40]\nFinally, silence falls as the rocket drifts into the vacuum of space, with only a faint mechanical hum in the background.",
